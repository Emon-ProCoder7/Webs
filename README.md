Mass Shootings have been a topic of intense discussion in the United States. A public database of mass shootings since 1982 has been made available by the [Mother Jones](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/12/mass-shootings-mother-jones-full-data/), a non-profit organization. I have build an app to explore these shootings data on an interactive map.

Imagine preparing a figure for a manuscript using R. We spend a lot of time recreating the same plot over and over again by rerunning the same code but changing small parameters each time. 
- Filter Table based on query,
- Download data, as filtered,
- The size of the points, 
- The color of the points, 
- The plot title, <br>


The data shown on the plotâ€”these criteria all have to be just right before publishing the figure. To save time from the hassle of rerunning the code many times, I have created a demo app with **gapminder** Dataset.
